            <p>We want an education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased and intellect is expanded by which one can stand on one's feet,‚Äù said Swami Vivekananda. It is in pursuit of this dream of Swami Ji, that the foundation of STRENGTH India Educational Society was laid and thereafter, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies- Technical Campus (VIPS-TC) was established in 2000. <br><br>

                Even as a sapling, its roots were firm, for they were energized by Swamiji's teachings. Today, VIPS has grown into a banyan tree, nestling sixteen courses. We continue to stand with determination, moral sight and strength of mind to create capable and ethical human beings with infinite power, infinite knowledge and indomitable positive energy. <br>
